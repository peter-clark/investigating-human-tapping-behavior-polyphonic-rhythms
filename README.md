## Analytical Flattening and Predictive Modeling of Tapping to Polyphonic Drum Patterns

**Abstract**
A study on human tapping to proposed rhythm patterns is presented here. We provide data and models that improve our knowledge about that phenomenon, specifically focusing on the induction of monophonic rhythm contours (MRC) when listening to polyphonic drum patterns, and the other way back. An inherent goal of the study is to delve into abstract, generative and powerful representations of rhythms. Three experiments are presented and discussed. In Experiment 1, 43 participants utilized a force-sensitive interface to maintain tap force within three regions (low, mid, and high). Our analysis focused on predicting the consistency of participants in tapping within these regions. In Experiment 2, the same participants tapped along 16 polyphonic drum patterns (one bar length) with identical drum kit sounds and tempo. Our analysis aimed to predict the correlation between participants’ tapped contours and various analytical methods for obtaining MRC. These methods encompassed algorithmic descriptors reflecting structural elements such as meter, syncopation, and brightness in rhythm. Although prior research on rhythm tapping with monophonic patterns indicates the influence of induced meter on tapped force, no experiments using polyphonic drum patterns have been conducted before. Moreover, existing research in rhythm perception suggests an inverse relationship between brightness and salience in rhythmic events (e.g., pulse entrainment and syncopation), but the influence of brightness on tapped force had not been measured before. Our investigation aimed to determine which analytical reduction method best characterizes subjects’ tapped rhythmic contours and frequency-weighted onset density (FWOD) emerged as a critical factor when tapping along a polyphonic drum pattern. Finally, in Experiment 3, various analytical methods for obtaining MRCs were tested and FWOD demonstrated superior accuracy in recalling parent polyphonic patterns from a rhythm space. We believe the results of this research will allow the development of new musical applications and tools for music creation based on the new knowledge gathered on rhythm representation.
